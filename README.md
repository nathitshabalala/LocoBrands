# Project: LocoBrands - Revolutionizing Local Shopping Online

I'm excited to share my work on **LocoBrands**, an e-commerce platform designed to empower small, local businesses by connecting them with a broader online audience. Through LocoBrands, local brands can list their products—from handmade crafts to specialty goods—on a single platform, expanding their reach without the need for individual online stores. As part of the project, we developed a streamlined B2C model that provides seamless product discovery, checkout, and customer support.
